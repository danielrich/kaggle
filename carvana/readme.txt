This is a competition I am using for exploration of deep learning techniques.

Basically we are creating a mask that is placed over car images so that only the car is left in the image.

I want to try.

1. GAN generative adversarial networks.
2. Normal ConvNets.
3. Perhaps a computer vision based approach.
